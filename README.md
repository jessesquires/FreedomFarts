# Freedom Farts

*Join the Fart Party! In God, We Fart.*
>Greetings Patriots! Welcome to the **Fart Party** - the one and only **bifartisan** effort to unite patriots from all political **farties**! Fed up with politicians just **farting** around in Washington DC? Can't decide who to vote for in our **two-farty** political system? Tired of feeling like you're stuck between two **farts** that both stink? Don't have the proper **farter** ID? **Fart** it! Join the **Fart Party**.

>Remember to [vote on Election Day](http://www.vote411.org) and if you can't vote, keep **farting** — *it's just as effective!*

## About

Freedom Farts is the politically-themed, satirical fart app for iOS that never was. It was originally submitted to the App Store in October, 2012 -- just in time for the [2012 Presidential Election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012). (*Wasn't that exciting!*) However, it was rejected by Apple because "[too many fart apps](http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/09/apples-app-store-review-guidelines-we-dont-need-any-more-far/)".

After rejection, an appeal to the Apple Review Board was submitted immediately but the rejection was upheld. 

I've decided that this app shouldn't simply collect dust on my HDD. So, here it is -- free and open-source. It has since been streamlined and updated for iOS 7.

## Why?

Politics has become so absurb in the United States, so I made this app to reflect my distaste, disapproval, disrespect, and disgust for American politics in a humorous way. Also, farts will never be not funny.
